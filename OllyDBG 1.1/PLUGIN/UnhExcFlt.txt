THEORY:

When  exception happens, Win2K/XP gives control to NTDLL!KiUserExceptionFilter,
which  in turn calls KERNEL32!UnhandledExceptionFilter. This function checks if
faulty  software  is  being  debugged.  If  not, UnhandledExceptionFilter calls
softwares' exception handler.



SOLUTION:
 
Patch  KERNEL32!UnhandledExceptionFilter  so that softwares' exception handler
is  always  called.  Used  signatures  work  for both Win2K SP4/WinXP SP1, and
hopefully for all other versions.



FEATURES:

Plugin  works  under win2k/xp, Olly 1.09/1.10, tested on english versions only.
I made it for myself, so there might be some bugs/missing features/etc. You are
welcome to send feedback.

When you need, you should press Plugins-UnhandledExceptionFilter-Patch. It will
allow  debugged  application to receive all exceptions. You can restore default
Windows behavior pressing Plugins-UnhandledExceptionFilter-Restore.

When program is restarted in Olly, patch must be applied again!
